## Information
* We do not support any spoons. Anything to do with spoons (Issues or PRs) will be ignored.
* We are using the [InvMenu](https://github.com/Muqsit/InvMenu) virion.
    * In other words, you must use the pre-compiled phar from [Poggit-CI](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/DaPigGuy/PiggyBackpacks/~) instead of GitHub.
    * If you wish to run it via source, check out [DEVirion](https://github.com/poggit/devirion).
* Need help? Check out our configuration documentation at [PiggyDocs](https://piggydocs.aericio.net/PiggyBackpacks.html).
